<h1>Website Documentation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>

This website gives visitors information on the London Championships 2017 including the athletes, events, the stadium and the mascot. Initially it was developed using HTML-Kit, however, after some recommendations from more experienced web developers, it was completed using Brackets as it offered a better user interface. Photoshop was used to edit images such as the opacity of the background image that appears in the navy bar to improve readability of the links.

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
For accessibility I took influence from Moodle which I use daily here at university. It allows users to increase and decrease the size of text and gives the option of inverting colours. I have implemented a basic system to change the font size but it only allows for two values which is not ideal.

<h2>Security</h2>
The site is hosted on a university server which requires a user name and password to be able to access which solves a lot of security issues. External links where only used with websites that use HTTPS as it means all communications between those websites and the users will be encrypted, as it is with my own website.

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
I would have liked to have gone more in-depth with my accessibility options, adding more text sizes and the inverted colours system as I mentioned as well as having the options on all pages, however due to time constraints and lack of previous experience I have had to leave these options out for this assessment. As part of the first assessment I mentioned having an interactive social media section. This idea was scrapped and replaced with a slideshow on the homepage and separate links to social media due to time constraints but I would like to have it added eventually. Meta tags should be added to help increase traffic to the site, however since it will not be publicly available, I have left this out.
